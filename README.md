# Super Paper
A mod for Balatro that adds Super Paper Mario-themed Jokers, consumables, decks, and more!

Unfinished and not production-ready. Mod install instructions & feature documentation will come at a later date.

Thank you to the Balatro Discord members for code help, Steamodded contributors for their fantastic tooling & documentation, the VanillaRemade contributors for insight on how vanilla features work in SMODS, and to the developers of various mods for inspiration on how to implement many different things. (will expand on these credits around when the mod is actually released lol)
